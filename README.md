## Newbie Notes
1. What's the difference between `def` and `defn`?

  > `def`s are evaluated only once wehereas `defn`s (with or without arguments) are evaluated (execuated) every time they are called. If your function alweays return the same value, you can change them to `def`s.

2. Access Java library using dollar sign (Java interop)
  Rescource from [Java interop with Clojure and Mahout](http://pseudofish.com/java-interop-with-clojure-and-mahout.html): Java allows for classes to be nested. However, Clojure doesn't provide an obvious way of referencing them.

  For example, Hadoopâ€™s SequenceFile includes SequenceFile.Writer and SequenceFile.Reader.
  To access these in Clojure, the period is replaced by a dollar sign.

    ...
      write (SequenceFile$Writer. fs conf path
                                  (class Text)
                                  (class VectorWritables))
    ...
